The total land mass of earth is formed by seven(7) continents of various sizes. Some are conneted to each other while others are not.
All of them have a different number of countries forming them. The names of the seven(7) continents of the world are:

<div style="color: red";>

<em>
<a href="Page 1.html"> ASIA </a> |
<a href="Page 2.html"> AFRICA </a> |
<a href="Page 3.html"> EUROPE </a> |
<a href="Page 4.html"> NORTH AMERICA  </a> | 
<a href="Page 5.html"> SOUTH AMERICA </a> |
<a href="Page 6.html"> AUSTRALIA </a> |
<a href="Page 7.html"> ANTARCTICA </a> |
</em>
</div>

All the continents of the earth starts and ends with the same alphabet considering North and South Americas as one continent.
Earth is around 71% of water and 29% of land. In fact, billions of years ago, the seven continents of the world were joined together as a single massive land mass 
called PANGAEA. But thanks to plate tectonics, they gradually broke apart and separated. Research says, every year Europe and North America are still moving apart 
at the rate of 7cm.
